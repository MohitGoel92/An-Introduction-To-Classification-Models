# Classification Bootcamp

This repository contains an introductory course on classification models. This repository contains basic datasets to illustrate the core concepts we will be exploring, however, you are encouraged to practice on datasets of your interest in order to find interesting insights.

## Introduction

Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning is applied everywhere, for instance the Google search engine, Netflix or Amazon recommender systems, Facebook facial recognition, and Alexa/Siri (speech to text via natural language processing).

Machine learning is the study of algorithms that teach computers to learn from experience. Through experience (more training data), computers can continuously improve their performance.

#### The process:

- Step 1: Feed training data
- Step 2: Analyse data
- Step 3: Find patterns
- Step 4: Perform predictions and make a decision
- Step 5: Learn from experience
