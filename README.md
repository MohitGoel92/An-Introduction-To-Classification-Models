# Classification Bootcamp

This repository contains an introductory course on classification models. This repository contains basic datasets to illustrate the core concepts we will be exploring, however, you are encouraged to practice on datasets of your interest in order to find meaningful insights.

**Note:** This course builds upon the "Python Basics for Data Analytics" course which can be found using the link below:

We will be using Juypter notebook that comes with the Anaconda Navigator GUI. This can be downloaded by using the following link:

## Introduction

Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning is applied everywhere, for instance the Google search engine, Netflix or Amazon recommender systems, Facebook facial recognition, and Alexa/Siri (speech to text via natural language processing).

Machine learning is the study of algorithms that teach computers to learn from experience. Through experience (more training data), computers can continuously improve their performance.

#### The process:

- Step 1: Feed training data.
- Step 2: Analyse data.
- Step 3: Find patterns.
- Step 4: Perform predictions and make a decision.
- Step 5: Learn from experience.

#### The big picture

- **Artificial Intelligence:** The science that enables computers to mimic human intelligence. Subfields inlcude machine learning, robotics and computer vision.
  - **Machine Learning:** The subset of AI that enables machines to improve at tasks with experience.
    - **Supervised Learning:** Training algorithms that use labelled input and output data. The performance is assessed by comparing the trained model prediction Vs the real output.
      - Regression and classification.
    - **Unsupervised Learning:** Training algorithms with no labelled data. It attempts at discovering hidden patterns on its own. These learning methods can analyse complex data that humans may find difficult to interpret. However, there is no feedback.
      - Clustering
    - **Reinforcement Learning:** Algorithms take actions to maximise the cumulative reward. Reinforcement algorithms learn by trial and error, through reward and penalty. There are two elements, they are the "environment" and "learning agent". Based on the reward or penalty, the agent improves its environment knowledge to make better decisions.
    - **Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning that utilises multi-layer Artificial Neural Networks. Deep Neural Networks are inspired by the human brain and mimics the operation of biological neurons.
